# Introduction

**Hard Science** is a Minecraft Mod with the following goals:

1. High-tech aesthetic - enable cool-looking high-tech builds with modern shapes and textures.

2. Scientific realism - honor foundational laws of physics: conservation of energy and matter, no transmutation of elements (unless you have a particle accelerator or fusion reactor), no teleportation, etc.

3. Challenging Gameplay - give the player interesting reasons to have all that high tech gear.

4. Still be Minecraft - the world is still made up of blocks.  Items in inventory are smaller and weigh less than they would in the real world. The mod doesn't strive for realism when the result would be tedium.

# Features in Active Development
The following features are expected in the initial release:

1) SuperBlocks.  Blocks that can be extruded into multiple shapes with user-selected colors and textures. Textures can be multi-layered and support glow effects. Block cost and strength depends on material selection.  (More to come.)

2) Basic resource progression.  Introductory tools and machines that can capture energy from the sun and air and turn it into building material and food.

3) [A volcano!](http://imgur.com/a/LKiov) An environmental hazard, the volcano emerges from deep underground and flows onto terrain over time, eventually becoming mountain-sized.

# Post-Release Features

1) Additional super-block shapes and textures, including new multi-block shapes like spheres, cylinders, prisms and more. 

2) Constructive solid geometry support for SuperBlocks.  Cut and join shapes together.

3) Advanced resource progression.

4) New environmental hazards.

5) Specialized world gen to create an even-more challenging play environment.

6) New high-tech adversaries.
