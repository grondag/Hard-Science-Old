# Adversity

Welcome to the repository for Adversity.

This mod is in active development and is currently not be available for download until after Minecraft 1.9 ships.  

Until further notice, please do not use this mod in ModPacks, nor in any world you want to keep.



DRAFT NOTES

COLUMN BLOCKS
While these blocks render as opaque blocks, and are indeed guaranteed to properly occlude adjacent blocks that aren't themselves, they do NOT properly occlude themselves unless faces that would normally be culled are drawn instead. They also have several times the polygon count of a typical building block. What does this all mean? They are slightly more expensive to render compared to normal square blocks, so don't go too crazy with them if your machine(s) have framerate challenges.

CONSTRUCTION COMPOSITE
Durable, attractive and cheap, "Comp Blocks" are the useful residue of mineral reprocessing.  Also useful later on as matter feedstock when advanced technologies come online.  

DURAPLAST
Already-durable construction composite infused with unobtanium nanobots, its internal matrix is powered by absorbed energy.  Able to withstand multiple direct heavy-weapon impacts, it will slowly self-repair if not completely destroyed. Incredibly tedious to remove once placed, you don't want to put this somewhere by mistake.  Automated building methods (or a DPST) are *strongly* advised.

UNOBTANIUM
A purely synthetic trans-atomic structure that could never naturally occur, unobtanium probably shouldn't exist yet somehow manages to do so. An old saw among material scientists is that anyone who needs Unobtanium explained to them is incapable of understanding the explanation.  Impossibly strong and can be either superconducting or a perfect insulator depending on nano patterning. 

EXOTIC MATTER
Perhaps the ultimate accomplishment of the physical sciences, exotic matter is the normal-space hull of a nine-dimensional Unobtanium matrix. Almost impossible to fabricate and outrageously demanding of resources, it possesses miraculous properties that enable myriad advanced technologies.  Anchored in hyperspace as it is, exotic matter is indestructible - to a point.  If that point is ever reached it fails in a cataclysmic way, but of course an energy release that causes such a failure implies that you already have larger problems. 

DPST
The Displacement Selection Tool has had the unfortunate but affectionate nickname of "Dipstick" when the Model K was introduced. Nobody fabricates the model K nowadays, but the name endures. The ultimate personal mining and construction tool, the DPST will direct a remote displacement facility to instantly remove or place blocks into or out of linked storage. Obviously, this is subject to range and power constraints of the displacement engine.
