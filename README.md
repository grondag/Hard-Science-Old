# Introduction

**Hard Science** is a Minecraft Mod with the following goals:

1. High-tech aesthetic - enable cool-looking high-tech builds with modern shapes and textures.

2. Scientific realism - honor foundational laws of physics: conservation of energy and matter, no transmutation of elements (unless you have a particle accelerator or fusion reactor), no teleportation, etc.

3. Challenging Gameplay - give the player interesting reasons to have all that high tech gear.

4. Still be Minecraft - the world is still made up of blocks.  Items in inventory are smaller and weigh less than they would in the real world. The mod doesn't strive for realism when the result would be tedium.
